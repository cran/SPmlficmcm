SemiParametric Maximum Likelihood for interaction in case-mother control-mother designs
}
\description{
Implementation of a method of general semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation for logistic models in case-mother control-mother designs. The method was proposed by \emph{Chen et al., (2012)} for the complete data and \emph{Nguile-Makao et al., (2013)} proposed an extension of the method allowing missing offspring genotype.

The package \pkg{SPmlficmcm} implements the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation method published by \emph{Chen et al., (2012)}. This method permits to analyze the interaction effects involving genetic variants and environmental exposures on the risk of adverse obstetric and early-life outcomes. \emph{Nguile-Makao et al., (2013)} proposed an extension of this method allowing missing offspring genotype. The package performs the analysis the following way: it builds the nonlinear system from the database, resolves the nonlinear system using the \code{\link[nleqslv]{nleqslv}} function of package \pkg{nleqslv}. It estimates the model parameters and the standard errors using the log profile likelihood function and the one-step method estimation. All this procedure may be done for complete data and also for missing offspring genotype. For more details see \emph{Chen et al., (2012)}, and \emph{Nguile-Makao et al., (2013)} . 
The modeling supposes that the distribution of maternal genotype and offspring genotype satisfy the following assumptions: \emph{random mating}, \emph{Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium} and \emph{Mendelian inheritance}. The package also permits to treat the missing offspring genotype data.
